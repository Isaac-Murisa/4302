##  Description of Project

For our CS 4302 Graphics project, we wanted to implement a Space environment where the user can walk-through observing different planets. However, due to time we could not implement the full features of the project. 

We have designed the project to resamble the planet 'earth' in space rotating at a fixed position. We have also included a 'Sun' feature which is a light source on the planet. Through the light source we can show the effect of day and night on the planet. We have defined a few navigation functions to be able to change the sun position. We have also included a skybox representing the space environment with stars and moon. This will give a background effect which allows us to pan around. 

The both the skybox and earth textures or images where sourced from a link which we have included in the project sources.

## User Manual and Instructions
To run the program, open the `index.html` file with a browser. After opening the file it should display the canvas with the earth on the middle. Below are the defined instructions to run the program:

- `Keyboard key L` - pressing this key allows the program to change the position of the Sun to the right side.
- `Keyboard key T` - pressing this key allows the program to change the position of the sun to the center or eye view.

## Diclaimer on Sources
The project is split into two parts, the first part is to apply texture to the sphere to resamble the earth. The second part is to apply texture to the skybox. For the first part we referenced the course code base provided in our class notes and for the second part on how to work with skybox we referenced class notes and from a repository.
